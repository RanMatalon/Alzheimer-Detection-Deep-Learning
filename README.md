# Alzheimer-Detection-Deep-Learning
In this project, i took the Alzheimer dataset from Kaggle, classified to 4 classes, while the goal is to classify correctly. I tried my own CNN that yielded better results than many other known CNNs. Yet, i didn't get good results at the beginning because of overfitting, when i added Drop-out layers it took much longer training, but  pretty helped.
